Quantum Wave Function Melody Generator

This introduces a digital music software that generates original compositions using the principles of quantum physics. Instead of random selections to determine notes, the system uses a sequence stream based on probability calculations using the Schrödinger Equation. The user interface visualizes the real and virtual parts of the wave function with different colors, while allowing users to track the probability of note formation through white flashes. These probability regions, arranged in vertical columns, are designed to transform scientific data directly into an auditory experience. In short, the source describes an interactive melody generation tool that operates at the intersection of quantum mechanics and art.
